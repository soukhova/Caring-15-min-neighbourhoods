### The 15-Minute City

- a normative conceptualisation gaining ground in urban planning: reaching daily necessities/activities within 15\* minutes by walk, bike\*, and transit\*. `r Citep(bib, c("Allam2022","moreno_introducing_2021"))`

- Practical challenges:
  - Non-specific: 15-minutes? By which travel modes?
  - **For whom? To what destination?**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figures/15-m-city.jpg"))
```

???

Let's apply a gendered lens. The research objective: answering **For whom? To what destination?** with Mobility of Care

---

### The 15-Minute City and Mobility of Care

- Mobility of Care is _also_ a normative conceptualisation; coined in `r Citep(bib, c("sanchezdemadariagaMobilityCareIntroducing2013"))`, emphasizes all travel needed to sustain yourself and the household, i.e., all non-paid work related travel. 

- Mobility of Care trips are often: under 15 minutes, proximate to home, and more frequently conducted by non-car modes (than work trips). Pair well with the 15-Minute City conceptualisation

- **Guiding research aim**: a method to identify what neighbourhoods are, are somewhat, and are not 15-minute _caring_ neighbourhoods

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}

```

???

Mobility of Care... concerns everyone But as it stands, concerns women most.

- This type of travel has been traditionally understudied: 1) travel from home-to-work is often the focus of transportation planning, 2) travel surveys to inform this planning often obscure and other mobility of care travel.

### Quantifying 15-minute caring neighbourhoods

.pull-left[

#### A) Spatial accessibility of care destinations

How _many_ care destinations can be reached within a 15 minute walk? The _potential of opportunities for interaction_ `r Citep(bib, "hansenHowAccessibilityShapes1959")`.

  - Dependent-centric care destinations
  - Errand-centric care destinations
  - Grocery-centric care destinations
  - Health-centric care destinations

$S_i = \sum_j O_j f(c_{ij})$

] 

.pull-right[

#### B) The diversity of categories

What is the _mix_ of care destination types within a 15 minute walk? The entropy measure:

$D_{i} = \frac{-\sum_{c} S_i^{c} / \sum_{c}S^{c}_{i} \times ln(S_i^{c} / \sum_{c}S^{c}_{i} )}{ln(n_c)}$

] 

- $i$ is a set of parcel point origin locations; $j$ is a set of destination locations.
- $O^_j$ is a number of opportunities at $j$.
- $c_{ij}$ is the travel cost between $i$ and $j$.
- $f(\cdot)$ is an impedance function of $c_{ij}$; within the cumulative opportunity approach, it is a binary function that takes the value of 1 if $c_{ij}$ is less than a selected value

### Typology and Profiles of 15-minute caring neighbourhoods: clustering via Self Organizing Maps

- To combine the Spatial Accessibility measures and the Diversity measure, and to profile the neighbourhoods, SOM is implemented.

- SOM is a pattern recognition method which reduces the dimensionality of the data into clusters without relying on any assumptions about the data structure. 

The SOM procedure:
1 ) five superclusters of the four $S_i^c$ scores and the diversity score $D_i$ are identified. The number of superclusters strike a balance between variance explained and supercluster interpretation in what we define as ranging from "not caring" to "very caring" and "not complete" to "complete". 

2) The superclusters are profiled using a variety of socio-economic and demographic indicators that the mobility of care literature finds significant.

```

very caring (mean 4 to 18.6; total p50 46) - very complete (div=0.9; p50 0.90) (Cluster 2)
caring (mean 2.1 to 9; total p50 18) - complete (div=0.81; p50 0.82) (Cluster 1)
somewhat caring (0.2 to 6; total p50 13) - complete (div=0.71; p50 0.74) (Cluster 4)
somewhat caring (0.2 to 6; total p50 7) - not complete (div=0.36; p50 0.40) (Cluster 3)
not caring (0 to 4.7; total p50 3) - not complete (div=0.02; p50 0) (Cluster 5)

### Profiles of 15-minute caring neighbourhoods typologies

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(glue::glue(here::here(), "/figures/access_sc_profiles_renamed.png"))
```

- Lower income households tend to reside in $\color{Green}{\text{very completely caring}}$ or $\color{GreenYellow}{\text{completely caring}}$ neighbourhoods; 
- Those with a `r emo::ji("up_arrow")` proportion of children tend to reside in $\color{orange}{\text{somewhat caring - not complete}}$ neighbourhoods;
- Higher income households in DAs with a `r emo::ji("down_arrow")` of single-parent households tend to reside in $\color{red}{\text{not caring - not complete}}$ neighbourhoods.


???

All variables that are tested:  Income_bottom + Age_0to14 + One_parent_families + Vis_minority + Not_in_labforce+ Income_gini+ walk_towork+ Owner_hld_CHN+ Hld_ownership+ Tenant_subsi_hld+ Tenant_hld_CHH+ LICO


Of a list of socio-economic variables, ones that characterise the 5 typologies the most are: 1) % in bottom half of the household income distribution, 2) children population (0 to 14) %, 3) single-parent household %, and 4) Low Income Cutoff (LICO) % 

Who has resides in $\color{Green}{\text{very completely caring}$ or $\color{GreenYellow}{\text{completely caring}$ neighbourhoods?  (maybe people who cannot afford cars???)
- DAs that have lower median household incomes and a smaller children population (lower than 24% of the population are children 14 and under).
- and DAs which have especially high LICO are often in $\color{Green}{\text{very completely caring}$ neighbourhoods.

Who more often resides in $\color{BurntOrange}{\text{somewhat caring - not complete}$ neighbourhoods?  
- Of bottom income DAs, DAs with a high proportion of children population (higher than 24% of the population are children 14 and under).

Who more often resides in $\color{BrickRed}{\text{not caring - not complete}$ neighbourhoods?  
- DAs of higher income DAs and with lower proportion of single-parent households (13% or lower)

### Conclusions: classifying and profiling caring 15-minute neighbourhoods

.pull-left[

#### What we did:

- 15 minute-city is bridged with "Mobility of Care": 15-minute caring neighbourhoods.
- A data-driven pattern recognition method (Self-organizing maps) to create **15-minute caring neighbourhood** typologies using **accessibility** and **diversity** indicators is presented.
- Using Self-Organizing Maps again; each parcel tagged with a neighbourhood typology was profiled based on all relevant census variables.
]

.pull-right[

#### What we found and future considerations:

- **Gentrification concerns**: populations residing in completely caring neighbourhoods are often lower-income and vice-versa.

- **Concerning caring for children and children's self-care**: Lower-income DAs with a `r emo::ji("up_arrow")` proportion of children, and DAs with `r emo::ji("up_arrow")` proportion single-parent households have medium complete care access, why?
