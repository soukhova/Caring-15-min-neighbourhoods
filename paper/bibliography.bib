	abstract = {A suﬃcient number of studies have highlighted that walkable neighborhoods can help to reduce the risk of obesity and noncommunicable diseases ({NCDs}). The Chinese government advocates the 15-minute (15-min) walkable neighborhoods to provide citizens with 15-min walkable access to basic public services, and ultimately to improve walking behavior and overall health. Following the Walk Score metric, this paper proposes a modiﬁed method for measuring 15-min walkable neighborhoods and applies it to Shanghai, China. Based on amenity access, the assessment considers walking demands of diﬀerent pedestrian groups (i.e., the entire population, children, adults, and seniors), the amenity attributes (scale and category), and the real traﬃc conditions. Spatial regression is further performed to determine whether signiﬁcant associations exist between community socioeconomic status and 15-min walkable neighborhoods score. Results show clear variations in 15-min walkable neighborhoods score for diﬀerent pedestrian groups. Regarding the overall 15-min walkable neighborhoods, highly walkable communities are primarily concentrated in the central areas; and that poorly walkable communities are dispersed in rural areas. Senior-concentrated and adult-concentrated communities are more likely to present higher walkability, while children-concentrated communities exhibit lower walkability. Moreover, communities with inferior walkability are characterized by a high proportion of ﬂoating population (nonresidents). This research provides future studies with references for evaluating 15-min walkable neighborhoods. Social inequalities in 15-min walkable neighborhoods should be emphasized, and interventions in planning implementation for building healthy communities in China should be targeted.},

It compares the mobility of these groups to that of the general population in three Canadian urban areas of Hamilton, Montreal and Toronto, based on data from large-sample metropolitan transport surveys. An ordered probit model with spatially expanded coefficients is used for the analysis. Spatial expansion shows that there are spatial mobility trends for elderly populations and low-income populations even after socio-economic attributes are accounted for. Such spatial differences are not generally found for single parent families. This novel spatial analysis provides clues as to where vulnerable populations may experience greater degrees of social exclusion. It provides information to help prioritize transportation infrastructure projects or other social programs to take into account the needs of vulnerable populations with the lowest levels of mobility.},

A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.

Previous studies have reported inconsistent ﬁndings on the association between 3D's (density, diversity, design) and walking behavior, and few studies have been conducted in China. The aim of this study was to identify the association between objectively measured 3D's and different domains of walking (transport vs. leisure) in Hong Kong, China. A survey was conducted in 2014 to collect walking data and relevant individual data from 1078 participants aged 18–65. The participants were randomly selected from 36 Hong Kong housing estates with different built environment and neighborhood socioeconomic status ({SES}). Built environment factors—population design, land-use mix and street intersection density—were assessed using a geographic information system. Multi-level regression was used to explore the associations between walking behavior and built environment factors, while adjusting for covariates. Two out the three D's—land-use mix and street connectivity—are not signiﬁcantly related to any domains of walking. Furthermore, the third D, population density, is only positively related to walking for transport and walking for leisure in the lower range of density, while is negatively related to walking for leisure in the higher range of density. The ﬁndings suggest that the association between original 3D's and walking may vary in different urban contexts. The policy or planning strategy—using three D's to promote physical activity—may be ineffective or even counterproductive in large and already dense cities in China.},

	abstract = {Background: To date, nearly all research on physical activity and the built environment is based on self-reported physical activity and perceived assessment of the built environment.
Objective: To assess how objectively measured levels of physical activity are related with objectively measured aspects of the physical environment around each participant’s home while controlling for sociodemographic covariates.
Methods: Objective measures of the built environment unique to each household’s physical location were developed within a geographic information system to assess land-use mix, residential density, and street connectivity. These measures were then combined into a walkability index. Accelerometers were deployed over a 2-day period to capture objective levels of physical activity in 357 adults.
Results: Measures of land-use mix, residential density, and intersection density were positively related with number of minutes of moderate physical activity per day. A combined walkability index of these urban form factors was signiﬁcant (p ϭ0.002) and explained additional variation in the number of minutes of moderate activity per day over sociodemographic covariates. Thirty-seven percent of individuals in the highest walkability index quartile met the Ն30 minutes of physical activity recommended, compared to only 18\% of individuals in the lowest walkability quartile. Individuals in the highest walkability quartile were 2.4 times more likely (conﬁdence intervalϭ1.18 – 4.88) than individuals in the lowest walkability quartile to meet the recommended Ն30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day.
Conclusions: This research supports the hypothesis that community design is signiﬁcantly associated},

              {LDI}
              ) model – as a possible urban sustainability criterion. The term ‘land‐use diversity’ is proposed as representative of many physical attributes of neighbourhood form opposite to typical sprawl patterns. A diverse neighbourhood is one with a mixture of compatible land uses and housing types, containing an array of amenities in reasonable proximity to where people live. The prototype version of the
              {LDI}
              model incorporates 34 input variables, structured around four sub‐indices. Its range of expected values are explored through four case study applications. Theoretically, index values can vary between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a condition of greater ‘land‐use diversity’. The two traditional urban neighbourhoods fared well (index values ranging between 0.627 and 0.726) because they have a greater range of land uses and neighbourhood amenities, a better integration of housing types and are more concentrated. These two neighbourhoods meet many of the ‘exuberant diversity’ criteria described by Jacobs. The two suburban neighbourhoods scored lower index values (between 0.250 and 0.363), indicating variables different to those for traditional urban forms. The
              {LDI}
              model differs from existing sprawl measures fundamentally, as it attempts to measure sprawl at a finer resolution (i.e. at the neighbourhood scale). It is anticipated the

Many land-use mix measures require fine-scaled land-use data that are not always available, especially when analyzing walkability across larger geographic extents. This study investigated the feasibility of calculating a national walkability index in Australia, using metropolitan Melbourne as a case study. The study focused on the dual challenges of selecting an appropriate measure of land-use mix and identifying an appropriate land-use data source. We calculated an entropy land-use mix measure with three different Australian land-use datasets. Our comparison of the resulting land-use mix measures highlighted the differences in the land-use datasets and led to our conclusion that none of the three land-use datasets was appropriate for use in a national land-use mix measure. Therefore, we also developed two new exploratory "intensity" measures of land use — daily living and local living — that were able to be calculated nationally with readily available data. Modelled associations with transport walking and comparisons with the entropy land-use mix measures indicate that these new measures were appropriate for assessing national land use in a national walkability index.},

Though a few studies have considered diversity in evaluating accessibility, diversity and the love of diversity have not been simultaneously included in one indicator. This study proposes a method to tackle this challenge, incorporating the constant-elasticity-of-substitution function, with a parameter on the preference for diversity (ρ), into the accessibility indicator of the two-step ﬂoating catchment area method (2SFCA). This new method ({AC}) is implemented to measure Beijing's job accessibility at the jiedao scale which is the basic administrative level in Chinese cities, and compared with the 2SFCA method ({AG}) and the 2SFCA method with an entropy component for job diversity ({AE}). All three indicators reveal a similar overall spatial pattern of job accessibility. However, measured by rank of accessibility score, there are some diﬀerences between them. Most jiedaos' ranks change when the {AE} method is used instead of the {AG} method, though most changes are within a small range. In contrast, when the {AC} method is used with the ρ-value close to 1, meaning that diversity is almost not valued at all, only a few jiedaos' ranks change. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the accessibility scores' absolute values with the {AC} method are highly sensitive to the ρ-value, but the overall spatial patterns seem not to be. However, with {AC}, a small decrease in ρ changes the jiedaos' ranks signiﬁcantly. Overall, the results indicate that the {AC} method provides better understanding of accessibility for regions with diﬀerent preferences on diversity of opportunities.},

The extensive academic literature on job accessibility measurements suggests that there are many ways to represent, deﬁne, quantify, and interpret job accessibility. These measurements have been increasingly employed for exploring urban issues at varied spatial scales. However, in practice, an appropriate balance is required between the complexity of representation, accuracy of measurement and ease of interpretation and use. With this in mind, this paper demonstrates a modiﬁed measurement to represent, measure, and interpret, job accessibility and job opportunity, by incorporating the effects of competition, distance decay and job diversity. The measurement integrates a probabilistic methodology with a spatial interaction model. The methodology is implemented in a {GIS} environment and illustrated using the Amsterdam region of the Netherlands as a case study. We argue that this measurement can improve the application of job accessibility measurement for planning support practices.},

   abstract = {This paper puts forward a commuter-based version of the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method, which has gained acceptance in studies on spatial health care accessibility. Current implementations of the 2SFCA method are static in that they consider centroid-based night-time representations of the population. The proposed enhancement to the 2SFCA approach addresses this limitation by accounting for trip-chaining behavior. The presented method is illustrated in a case study of accessibility of daycare centers in the province East Flanders in Belgium. The results show significant spatial differences in accessibility between the original and commuter-based version of the 2SFCA (CB2SFCA). They highlight the importance of giving heed to more complex travel behavior in cases where the need for detailed accessibility calculations is apparent.},

This article critically reviews this literature, and argues that it has come to focus on a relatively limited range of research problems (notably journey-to-work travel) at the expense of other relevant issues. An alternative approach is suggested which redefines the topic as ‘gender and daily mobility’ and incorporates it within a larger theoretical project investigating social and cultural geographies of mobility. Some areas of scholarship associated with the ‘cultural turn’ are explored to illustrate the potential for new approaches. The article then argues that future research on the topic must be based on a more systematic treatment of gender as a theoretical concept. A framework of analysis is outlined which identifies aspects of gender as a social category and symbolic code, and links it to aspects of daily mobility. The article outlines potential research questions identified through this analysis, and draws attention to a wide range of literature which may be brought to bear on the redefined topic area.},

Past examinations of accessibility to transit have considered the built environment and levels of service of transit. In contrast, accessibility by transit has received more limited attention in transit mode share analysis. The objective of this paper is to investigate the implications of accessibility to transit and by transit for mode shares in the city of Hamilton, Canada. We model transit shares by means of a logistic regression that takes into account over-dispersion and spatial autocorrelation. The results of the final model indicate that accessibility by transit is a significant predictor of modal share in our case study. Technically, our analysis clearly illustrates that ignoring over-dispersion and autocorrelation can result in misleading inference and erroneous policy prescriptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Private vehicle travel entails costs to society. However, in a world designed around the automobile, adults who lack access to a vehicle for economic reasons may experience a significant handicap due to constrained mobility and accessibility. This paper examines whether private vehicle access is associated with the quantity and quality of out-of-home activities in which lowincome individuals participate. We use pooled data from multiple time use surveys drawn from the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom, and employ Cragg two-part hurdle modeling to determine whether there is an association between household vehicle access and participation in twelve out-of-home activity types. As a robustness check, we also estimate multiple discrete continuous extreme value ({MDCEV}) models. Further, we examine travel time by mode for those with and without vehicles. Finally, we use American Time Use Survey data and fixed-effects panel models to determine the subjective well-being that is associated with our outof-home activity types. A lack of private vehicle access is associated with significantly less frequent out-of-home activity participation, both in the aggregate and for seven of the twelve individual activities. Moreover, the activities most likely to be foregone are generally associated with high subjective well-being, suggesting that constrained mobility comes with significant emotional costs. We find a greater “activity penalty” for rural residents and for Canadian residents without vehicle access; urbanites without vehicles in the U.K. are the only geographic group which do not exhibit an activity penalty. Finally, respondents with vehicle access spend more total time traveling, although those without private vehicles partially offset spending less time in them with higher use of alternative modes. Overall, the findings suggest that the lack of a private vehicle is deleterious for quality of life, raising troubling questions about inequity possibly arising when people are denied access to vehicles for economic reasons.},

This study models the impacts of household transportation resources on two education related outcomes: after-school activity participation and attendance at a non-local high school. We model after-school activity participation across the Greater Toronto Area through probit regression, identifying a signiﬁcant eﬀect of public transit accessibility on a high school student’s likelihood of participating in an after-school activity. We conduct a similar analysis predicting the likelihood that a student attends a non-local high school in the City of Toronto, wherein over 60\% of students attend one of several alternatives to local designated high schools. Finally, we conduct a biprobit Seemingly Unrelated Regression ({SUR}) on both variables to account for unobserved student and household characteristics that inﬂuence both outcomes. Our results highlight a signiﬁcantly positive association between transit accessibility and students’ participation in after-school activities. We identify a weakly signiﬁcant association between transit accessibility and attending non-local schools. We contend that while transportation resources may not be the most signiﬁcant factors inﬂuencing these outcomes, transportation plays a signiﬁcant enough role in students’ lives to warrant thoughtful attention by policymakers.},

	abstract = {The combined decentralisation of many firms and services and the increasing concentration of traditional public transport services in the main corridors of urban centres have made it more difficult for people to access jobs, in particular when residing outside these prime accessibility areas. This is the first national study within the context of Great Britain to examine whether better public transport job accessibility, modelled at the micro level of individuals, improves employment probabilities for people living in Great Britain. While previous studies have typically concentrated on {US} metropolitan areas, our study uses British national employment micro datasets to assess which urban and rural areas and population groups would benefit from better public transport services. In an important departure from most standard accessibility methodologies, we computed a public transport job accessibility measure applied nationwide and combined this with individual-level employment probability models for Great Britain. The models were corrected for endogeneity by applying an instrumental variable approach. The study finds that better public transport job accessibility improves individual employment probabilities, in particular in metropolitan areas and smaller cities and towns with lower car ownership rates and in low-income neighbourhoods. It further shows that mainly lower educated groups and young people would benefit from better public transport job accessibility. The findings in this study are important for policymakers in that they imply that, in particular, job seekers who rely on public transport services may benefit from more targeted public policies to improve their accessibility to employment and thereby their social mobility.},

Multinomial logistic regression shows that baseline access to automobiles has a strong positive relationship to follow-up employment but public transit access and receipt of housing assistance do not.

This urban planning concept proposes a city where residents can meet their essential needs within a short walking or cycling trip from their home. Local access to grocery stores is a necessary component for cities to achieve the 15-minute city. This study aims to evaluate local accessibility to grocery stores by walking and cycling in the City of Vancouver. We used a cu­ mulative opportunity measure to count the number of grocery stores available within a 15-minute walk and cycle from people’s homes. To evaluate accessibility from the perspective of younger and older travellers, we considered different travel speeds. Our results show there is good accessibility to grocery stores when cycling, with less than 1\% of the city’s population not having a grocery store within a 15-minute cycle. When assuming a walking speed of an older pedestrian, around one-fifth of the population did not have access to a grocery store in their local area. The neighbourhoods that did not have a store within a 15-minute walk had higher proportions of children, older adults, and visible minorities, and lower rates of employment and post-secondary education attainment. In seeking to improve accessibility via walking and cycling, cities should prioritize grocery store locations and investments in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure to underserved neighbourhoods and populations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost containment typically involves rationalizing healthcare service delivery through centralization of services to achieve economies of scale. Hospitals are frequently the chosen site of cost containment and rationalization especially in rural areas. Socio-demographic and geographic characteristics make hospital service allocation more difficult in rural and remote regions. This research presents a methodology to model rational catchments or service areas around rural hospitals--based on travel time. RESULTS: This research employs a vector-based GIS network analysis to model catchments that better represent access to hospital-based healthcare services in British Columbia's rural and remote areas. The tool permits modelling of alternate scenarios in which access to different baskets of services (e.g. rural maternity care or ICU) are assessed. In addition, estimates of the percentage of population that is served--or not served--within specified travel times are calculated. CONCLUSION: The modelling tool described is useful for defining true geographical catchments around rural hospitals as well as modelling the percentage of the population served within certain time guidelines (e.g. one hour) for specific health services. It is potentially valuable to policy makers and health services allocation specialists.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greater travel time to cancer care has been identified as a potential barrier to care as well as associated with worse health outcomes. While rural cancer patients have been shown to travel farther for care, it is not known what patient, facility, and clinical characteristics may differentially be associated with greater roundtrip travel times for cancer patients by rurality of residence. Identifying these factors will help providers understand which patients may be most in need of resources to assist with travel. METHODS: Using 2010-2014 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry data, we examined the association between patient, facility, and clinical characteristics with roundtrip patient travel time using multivariate linear regression models. We then estimated separate models by rural residence based on the Rural-Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) of a patient's county of residence at diagnosis to understand how the association of each factor with travel time may vary for patients separated into metro residents (RUCC 1-3); and two categories of non-metro residents (RUCC 4-6) and (RUCC 7-9). RESULTS: In our sample (n = 197,498), we document large differences in mean roundtrip travel time-mean 41.5 min for RUCC 1-3 patients vs. 128.9 min for RUCC 7-9 patients. We show cervical/uterine and ovarian cancer patients travel significantly farther; as do patients traveling to higher volume and higher-ranked hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: To better understand patient travel burden, providers need to understand that factors predicting longer travel time may vary by rurality of patient residence and cancer type.},

   abstract = {Accessibility indicators are widely used in transportation, urban and healthcare planning, among many other applications. These measures are weighted sums of reachable opportunities from a given origin, conditional on the cost of movement, and are estimates of the potential for spatial interaction. Over time, various proposals have been forwarded to improve their interpretability: one of those methodological additions have been the introduction of competition. In this paper we focus on competition, but first demonstrate how a widely used measure of accessibility with congestion fails to properly match the opportunity-seeking population. We then propose an alternative formulation of accessibility with competition, a measure we call spatial availability. This measure relies on proportional allocation balancing factors (friction of distance and population competition) that are equivalent to imposing a single constraint on conventional gravity-based accessibility. In other words, the proportional allocation of opportunities results in a spatially available opportunities value which is assigned to each origin that, when all origin values are summed, equals the total number of opportunities in the region. We also demonstrate how Two-Stage Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) methods are equivalent to spatial availability and can be reconceptualized as singly-constrained accessibility. To illustrate the application of spatial availability and compare it to other relevant measures, we use data from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey of the Greater Golden Horseshoe area in southern Ontario, Canada. Spatial availability is an important contribution since it clarifies the interpretation of accessibility with competition and paves the way for future applications in equity analysis (e.g., spatial mismatch, opportunity benchmarking, policy intervention scenario analysis).},

This urban planning concept proposes a city where residents can meet their essential needs within a short walking or cycling trip from their home. Local access to grocery stores is a necessary component for cities to achieve the 15-minute city. This study aims to evaluate local accessibility to grocery stores by walking and cycling in the City of Vancouver. We used a cu­ mulative opportunity measure to count the number of grocery stores available within a 15-minute walk and cycle from people’s homes. To evaluate accessibility from the perspective of younger and older travellers, we considered different travel speeds. Our results show there is good accessibility to grocery stores when cycling, with less than 1\% of the city’s population not having a grocery store within a 15-minute cycle. When assuming a walking speed of an older pedestrian, around one-fifth of the population did not have access to a grocery store in their local area. The neighbourhoods that did not have a store within a 15-minute walk had higher proportions of children, older adults, and visible minorities, and lower rates of employment and post-secondary education attainment. In seeking to improve accessibility via walking and cycling, cities should prioritize grocery store locations and investments in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure to underserved neighbourhoods and populations.},

   abstract = {As cities expand, human mobility has become a central focus of urban planning and policy making to make cities more inclusive and sustainable. Initiatives such as the "15-minutes city" have been put in place to shift the attention from monocentric city configurations to polycentric structures, increasing the availability and diversity of local urban amenities. Ultimately they expect to increase local walkability and increase mobility within residential areas. While we know how urban amenities influence human mobility at the city level, little is known about spatial variations in this relationship. Here, we use mobile phone, census, and volunteered geographical data to measure geographic variations in the relationship between origin-destination flows and local urban accessibility in Barcelona. Using a Negative Binomial Geographically Weighted Regression model, we show that, globally, people tend to visit neighborhoods with better access to education and retail. Locally, these and other features change in sign and magnitude through the different neighborhoods of the city in ways that are not explained by administrative boundaries, and that provide deeper insights regarding urban characteristics such as rental prices. In conclusion, our work suggests that the qualities of a 15-minutes city can be measured at scale, delivering actionable insights on the polycentric structure of cities, and how people use and access this structure.},

The two study areas chosen for comparison are a medium sized city without any major mobility problems (Santander, Spain) and a very large city with major congestion problems (Rome, Italy). The estimated hedonic models have considered the possible presence of spatial effects, a common occurrence with real estate data which may generate dependency in the residuals of hedonic models. Accessibility has been measured using two types of indicators: relative and gravity based. The results confirm that accessibility was a positive factor on property prices in both cities, although in Santander this was only true using the relative indicator to the city centre. These results are relevant for supporting the introduction of value capture policies which provide finance for new projects to extend and encourage greater use of public transport.},

Spatial accessibility can be measured many different ways, but many of methods in use today involve some measure of travel cost (in time or distance). In this study we explore a simple methodological question: how much are models of spatial accessibility inﬂuenced by the precise metric of travel cost? We address this question by comparing spatial accessibility to primary care physicians for two different methods of calculating travel cost (in time) on a street network: free-ﬂow travel time and congested with turn penalties travel timedwhich augments free-ﬂow travel times with the burden of trafﬁc congestion and trafﬁc intersection controls. We consider the effect of these two metrics of travel cost on a gravity-based measure of spatial accessibility to primary health care services in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Our results suggest that while travel times between locations of demand and locations of primary care providers greatly differ based on how travel cost is calculated, the gravity-based measure of spatial accessibility provides similar information for both travel cost metrics. Using congested with turn penalties travel time can be an onerous addition to the analysis of spatial accessibility, and is more useful for measuring absolute travel time rather than modeling relative spatial accessibility.},

	abstract = {As healthcare is a right in Canada, analyzing the distribution of spatial access to medical consultations, which are crucial for the prevention, diagnosis, and early treatment of illnesses, is fundamental to understanding health equity. Spatial accessibility can influence whether individuals can reasonably reach the services they seek. However, as an indicator of potential access, it does not guarantee realized access because of predisposing and need factors. This study examines the relationship between spatial accessibility to hospitals and the likelihood of consulting with a healthcare professional at a hospital in eight Canadian metropolitan regions while controlling for individual characteristics through multilevel regression modeling. Spatial accessibility was computed using the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. Self-reported consultations and socio-demographic characteristics were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey. We found that the likelihood of consultations differed between genders (female {OR}: 1.133, {CI}: 1.023-1.255; compared with male) and followed a positive household income gradient (high-income {OR}: 1.236, {CI}: 1.094-1.397; middle-income {OR}: 1.039, {CI}: 0.922-1.172; compared with low-income), but is not influenced by age. Living in areas with higher spatial accessibility was positively linked to consultations ({OR}: 1.014, {CI}: 1.000-1.028), even after controlling for perceived health ({OR}: 0.540, {CI}: 0.471-0.621), chronic conditions ({OR}: 1.738, {CI}: 1.587-1.904), and having a regular doctor ({OR}: 1.313, {CI}: 1.187-1.452). Policies that may improve spatial accessibility to healthcare services through increasing supply, managing demand, and enhancing level of public transport service should be considered to improve individuals' ability to consult healthcare professionals, potentially leading to better health outcomes.},

This article analyzes the relationship between access to automobiles and public transit and employment outcomes of low-income households. We use longitudinal survey data from participants in the Welfare to Work Voucher Program, which was conducted in five {US} metropolitan areas between 1999 and 2005. Multinomial logistic regression shows that baseline access to automobiles has a strong positive relationship to follow-up employment but public transit access and receipt of housing assistance do not. Our findings suggest that enhancing car access will notably improve employment outcomes among very-low-income adults, but other assistance will have, at best, marginal effects.},

	abstract = {In recent years the literature on mobility of care has rapidly expanded, and the concept offers a powerful lens to highlight how everyday mobilities are organised, undertaken, and experienced in gendered ways. The concept can nonetheless benefit from further theoretical development. In this paper we enrich the mobility of care concept by drawing on influential conceptualisations of care from feminist theory and analysis of data collected during the {COVID}-19 lockdown among a group of 40 low-income women living in peri-urban areas of Itagüí, a municipality in the south of the Medellín metropolitan area, Colombia. Through this approach we first argue that relying on a taxonomy of trip purposes limits the understanding of the role of care in urban mobilities and risks underestimating the prevalence of mobility of care. Second, we suggest that activities of self-care also generate mobility of care and that their consideration allows practices and experiences of receiving care to be considered. Finally, we show how care activities are part of, and generate, intertwined mobilities and immobilities, and argue that rendering visible the full extent of mobilities of care demands that careful consideration be given to im­ mobilities as well.},

              intersectionality
              has become the key analytic framework through which feminist scholars in various fields talk about the structural identities of race, class, gender, and sexuality. This chapter situates intersectionality within a long history of black feminist theorizing about interlocking systems of power and oppression, arguing that intersectionality is not an account of personal identity but one of power. It challenges feminist theorists, including Robyn Wiegman, Jennifer Nash, and Jasbir Puar, who have attempted to move past intersectionality because of its limitations in fully attending to the contours of identity. The chapter also maps conversations within the social sciences about intersectionality as a research methodology. Finally, it considers what it means for black women to retain paradigmatic status within intersectionality studies, whether doing so is essentialist, and therefore problematic, or whether attempts to move “beyond” black women constitute attempts at erasure and displacement.},

	abstract = {The spatial arrangement of a metropolis is of utmost importance to carry out daily activities, which are constrained by space and time. Accessibility is not only shaped by the spatial and temporal dimension, but it is also defined by individual characteristics, such as gender, impairments, or socioeconomic characteristics of the citizens living or commuting in this area. This study analyzes mobility trends and patterns in the metropolitan area of Barcelona before and after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, with special emphasis on gender and equality. The study draws on multiple sources of information; however, two main datasets are analyzed: two traditional travel surveys from the transport metropolitan area of Barcelona and two coming from smartphone data. The results show that gender plays a relevant role when analyzing mobility patterns, as already highlighted in other studies, but, after the pandemic outbreak, some population groups were more likely to change their mobility patterns, for example, highly educated population groups and those with higher income. This study also highlights that e-activities may shape new mobility patterns and living conditions for some population segments, but some activities cannot be replaced by IT technologies. For all these reasons, city and transport planning should foster sustainable development policies, which will provide the maximum benefit for society.},

	abstract = {A range of accessibility indicators has been developed in the past decade to evaluate equity in transportation within urban areas. Some studies have attempted to incorporate them in transport poverty metrics, focussing on insufﬁcient access to general services and employment. While accessibility measures coupled with statistics have been effective in assessing immediate households’ vulnerability, we argue that an analysis of their adaptive capacity could contribute to a better information of local policies in the long term. This paper aims to develop a methodology for mapping transport poverty risks at the metropolitan scale, while studying the relation between urban segregation and the transport divide. We use the case study of Lyon to operationalise our method and ﬁnd evidence of vulnerability patterns previously identiﬁed in the sociological literature. Beyond the sensitivity of households living in the ﬁrst-crown neighbourhoods and the growing exposure of medium-income families settling in peripheral municipalities, we emphasise the importance of using mixed methodologies to better capture households’ needs and mobility choices within suburban environments. We conclude by discussing shortcomings and future developments of our research.},

	abstract = {The question of the environmental or social costs of urban form is increasingly attracting attention in spatial policy, but scientiﬁc debate in this ﬁeld is often marred by prejudices and abstract visions; empirical analyses are very rare. The present study aims at establishing, in the metropolitan area of Milan, whether different patterns of urban expansion could be associated with speciﬁc environmental costs— in particular, for land consumption and mobility generation. Different typologies of urban expansion were deﬁned, and an impact index weighting differently journey-to-work trips with reference to mode and time length was built at the municipality level. The statistical analysis conﬁrmed the expected ‘‘wasteful’’ character of sprawling development patterns in terms of land consumption, though suggesting that recent urban development is becoming relatively ‘virtuous’ with respect to the past. With reference to the mobility generated, higher environmental impacts were proved to be associated with low densities, sprawling development, more recent urbanisation processes and residential specialisation of the single municipalities. Public transport seems to be strongly inﬂuenced, both in terms of efﬁciency and competitiveness, by the structural organisation of an urban area: the more dispersed and less structured the development, the lower its level of efﬁciency and competitiveness and consequently its share of the mobility market. On the contrary, trip times for private transport appear to be correlated not so much to urban dimension or density as to the presence of recent housing development, indicating the emergence of new models of lifestyle and mobility which are very different from those of the past. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	year = {2020},
	abstract = {In 1995 the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action affirmed that equality between women and men is a human right and necessary for social justice. Later, in 2015, the UN defined gender equality as one of the 17 sustainable development goals to transform the world. During all these years, gender and urban space have been the subject of studies and research, interventions, reflections, and discussions worldwide but also in Latin America and the Caribbean region. Following the path of urban equality, this paper presents a systematic review of the current predominant orientations in urban studies in Latin America and the Caribbean, organized according to three thematic axes which are of outermost importance in in the built environment: fear and insecurity, care, and mobility, putting special emphasis on the differences that gender constructs in the ways of conceiving the space and the city, the definition of women as research subjects and gender as a category of urban analysis. A systematic and rigorous review of the available evidence is carried out. For this purpose, we set three stages of analysis. First, we examine the theoretical and conceptual debates around the incorporation of gender in urban studies. Secondly, we turn our attention to empirical studies that point to the centrality of the urban environment in gender analysis. In the last section, a review of the main institutional responses to mobility, insecurity, and care problems in the region is carried out and manyfold examples of interventions are presented. Our study shows that, to achieve better results, gender equality needs to be reinforced by a participatory design approach involving all stakeholders, it needs to be achieved in all areas which have influence in urban and transport planning, and finally, that the COVID-19 pandemic may hinder previous achievements.},

The study compares ten industrialized countries across Asia, Europe, and North America. In all ten countries, gender differences in time use are smaller in personal care, sleeping and meals, followed by leisure time (including screen-based leisure and active leisure), and largest in housework, care work and paid work activities. Gender disparities in time use are higher in South Korea, Hungary, and Italy, followed closely by Spain, with moderate gender gaps in Western European countries like France and Netherlands, and lowest differences in Finland and Anglo-Saxon countries, including Canada, {US}, and the {UK}. Gender differences in housework and caring time increase from adolescence (10–17 years) to early adulthood (18–29 years), showing strong gender gaps in early/middle adulthood (30–44 years), but narrow again during late adulthood (65 years or older). However, the age gradient in care work and housework is most pronounced in Italy and South Korea, being less prominent in Canada and Finland. Gender gaps in paid work are larger in early/middle adulthood (30–44) and middle/late adulthood (45–64), with strongest age gradients observed in the Netherlands and weaker gradients for the {US}. Gender differences in active leisure increase by age, especially in Southern European countries, while screen-based leisure shows more stable gender gaps by age groups across different countries. Overall, this study shows that age and gender intersect strongly in affecting time-use patterns, but also that the national context plays an important role in shaping gender-age interactions in time use allocation.},

	abstract = {“Mobility of care” refers to the daily travel required to complete care labor such as travel to the grocery store, or to escort children. Though past research has examined the distribution of individual types of household-serving travel, little research to date, especially in the North American context, has examined mobility of care which combines all travel required to fulfill a household’s care needs. This paper presents the results of an exploratory analysis of mobility of care drawing on the 2018 Montreal Origin–Destination Survey. Specifically, this paper explores who completes this type of travel and how this mobility is completed. Findings indicate that mobility of care comprises 28\% of adults’ daily mobility. Further, women are found to complete more of this type of travel than men, especially women from lower-income households. The presence of children in the household further widens this gendered gap, though the number of children present does not alter this trend greatly. Mobility of care trips are shorter on average than other types of travel and are frequently completed as part of a trip-chain. Further, car use and walking are more frequently used for mobility of care than other types of travel, while the opposite is true for public transport and cycling. The use of public transport for mobility of care trips is greater amongst women than men, especially those living in lower-income households. Taken together, results highlight the importance for practitioners to explicitly address mobility of care in transport planning, and particularly in public transport planning.},

In part because of enhancements to the public realm and improved connectivity, areas along new transit lines witness significant growth and investment, making them less affordable for residents already there. However, very little research has examined experiences of transit-induced gentrification, particularly at the early stages of a new transit project. The purpose of this article is to document these experiences from the perspective of those living along the planned {LRT} corridor in Hamilton, Ontario. Importantly, our research was conducted before construction started. Through in-depth interviews with residents living within 800 m of the planned {LRT} route, we found disparate experiences of change and ongoing housing affordability concerns on an individual, neighbourhood, and city scale. Many Hamilton residents express a need for more community engagement and transparency in the decision-making process. We detail these experiences and offer policy recommendations to inhibit further housing insecurity and displacement in light of the {LRT} development.},

In sole parent households, the vast majority of which are headed by women, the functions of earning money and caring for children fall to one individual. The risk that sole mothers may fail to perform either or both of these functions adequately has made these women and their children a subject of social concern and policy interest. The financial consequences of sole motherhood have been extensively studied both in Australia and cross nationally. The other area of concern, that the children of sole mothers are disadvantaged in terms of parental attention, has not been systematically investigated. To begin addressing this research gap, this paper analyses the Australian Bureau of Statistics Time Use Survey 1997 (over 4000 randomly selected households) to establish whether, in Australia, the time sole mothers spend with their children differs in either quality or quantity from that of mothers, and/or fathers, in couple families. The related issue of whether sole mothers suffer more time pressure or time constraint than partnered mothers is also addressed.},

Without a second caregiver and earner, single parents have to compete with dual-earner couples for their position in the earnings distribution. Facing precarious employment and gendered wage inequality, single-parent families face a high risk to experience poverty even when they are working. This chapter presents empirical evidence on in-work poverty and inadequate wages in the policy context of 18 {OECD} countries. The impact of family structure, occupation, regulations of part-time work, paid parental leave, and various redistributive policies are examined. We distinguish three distinct patterns of performance in countries’ approach to in-work poverty among single parents: A balanced approach of ensuring low inequality on the labor market combined with redistribution, an unbalanced approach of combating in-work poverty mostly through redistribution, and an approach in which high inequality on the labor market is compensated with redistributive policies only to a very limited extent. Countries that rely on a balanced approach to reduce inequality on the labor market, both with respect to class and gender, combined with an adequate level of redistribution, seem best situated for a durable reduction of poverty among working single parents.},

In addition, there has been a lack of recent studies taking feminist and gendered approaches to housing studies. This is all the more surprising as, firstly, the number of women living under the poverty line and receiving housing assistance is considerably higher than men, and secondly, feminist perspectives have had considerable theoretical influence in the social sciences as a tool to understanding social and economic inequalities. In this article, I will be drawing on feminist theory on welfare states and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of gender and practice in order to explore the ways in which women who live below the poverty line in Australia are marginalized and kept in disadvantaged positions. In order to do so, I will draw on in‐depth interviews with women in two states, Victoria and New South Wales.},

This research seeks to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged areas in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area ({GTHA}), Canada, experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other areas over the course of a day. Comparisons are presented in terms of regional accessibility, trends by social decile, spatial distribution of accessibility during the day, and travel time impacts. Findings suggest that residents in socially disadvantaged areas have equitable if not better transit accessibility to jobs than socially advantaged groups, and this is reflected in shorter travel times. However, the degree and impact of this advantage varies over the course of the day. Findings from this research can be of interest to transportation planners, engineers, and policy makers as it highlights deficiencies with current equity assessment practices that do not take into account variation in transit services over a 24-h time period.},

	abstract = {The need to improve the sustainability of daily mobility in urban areas has been high on the political agenda worldwide. One major concern has been that of the growing car dependency. The growing distance between the activities human carry out has naturally been at the root of such phenomena. Efficient transport systems and high travel speeds have enabled access to ever distant opportunities. On the flip side, such conditions have reduced the need for proximity, which in turn has led to a distancing between human activities and to greater car dependency. For this paper we built a theoretical framework that hypothesises the existence of a negative feedback loop between local and regional accessibility (illustrated above). We then provide initial empirical research into the feedback loop. We explore how high regional accessibility has contributed to losses in local accessibility by enabling concentration of population in local low accessibility environments (one of the two explanatory phenomena behind the negative feedback). Our research uses a 2-step approach to, first, reveal the spatial relationship between local and regional accessibility levels, and then to explore the influence of urban development periods on such relationship. We use a European metropolitan context for this exploratory research (the metropolitan area of Porto), making use of a cross-sectional database on local and regional accessibility levels, supported by longitudinal data on population distribution and building age, both at a high spatial detail level. Local and regional accessibility levels are assessed for 15-min travel distance by foot and by car, respectively. In the absence of longitudinal data on accessibility levels, it was not possible to directly observe the hypothesised feedback cycle. Nevertheless, we found evidence of two necessary, though insufficient, conditions of said cycle. In line with the hypotheses, we found significant amounts of the population living in high regional and low local accessibility contexts (around 17\%). We also found evidence of higher concentration of recent urban development in areas offering low local and high regional accessibility levels, in comparison to their high local accessibility counterparts. Indeed, these areas show significant population growth, growing at a faster rate than their high local accessibility counterparts. These findings encourage further research into the hypothesised feedback loop.},

	abstract = {Recognised as an important dimension of quality of life, accessibility has gained increasing attention from research and planning practice in the last decades. Rising concern with global warming and the dehumanization of cities has spotlighted the proximity-centred dimension of accessibility, which for decades has been mostly undervalued. In both research and practice, we witness a rise in references to proximity-centred accessibility, however, using a variety of different terms, with somewhat nuanced meanings or underlying concerns. Proximity-centred accessibility concepts are still in flux, inhibiting the establishment of a comprehensive understanding for the development of a cohesive research field and of effective public policies. This paper provides a first contribution to the development of a conceptual framework for proximity-centred accessibility, through a co-development process involving both research and practice. For this we used a mixed methods approach incorporating bibliographic research, surveys, and a focus group, involving both experts in the research field and a sample of planning practitioners from Portugal and Germany. Our research revealed over a dozen different proximity-centred accessibility terms currently in use in the scientific research field, of which, local accessibility and neighbourhood accessibility are the most commonly used. A difference in favoured terminology was identified between research and practice as well as different national contexts, requiring further explorations. While Proximity thresholds have been defined using a variety of physical distances or travel times, our survey revealed a nearly unanimous consensus around a threshold of 1600 m (roughly 20 min walking). Mixed evidence was found with regard to activities relevant at proximity. Regardless, playgrounds, green spaces, food shopping and elementary education showed particular relevance. Building on the empirical evidence collected, we strike out a first conceptual framework for proximity-centred accessibility. Building on the general definition for accessibility, we include a maximum distance threshold of 1600 m to consider accessibility as proximity-centred. The proposed framework encourages multiple distances (up to 1600 m), transport modes, and activities (although the relevance of activities seems to be clearly dependent of distance and local context). The importance of clearly specifying the exact distances, transport mode(s) and activities for each application of the framework is stressed.},

	abstract = {Urban areas encompass essential social functions that are fundamental for the development and quality of life. This research explores why the concept of the 15-minute city, while commendable in its aspirations, might fall short in effectively mitigating urban inequalities, especially within densely populated and segregated developing cities. Using Bogotá (Colombia) as a case study, this paper advocates and develops a standardized index based on the availability of essential urban functions within a 15-minute walking distance. This index also integrates individual preferences, geographical attributes, and the quality of pedestrian infrastructure. Doing so provides a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing proximity, accommodating the diverse needs of various social identities. Considering individual preferences towards proximity is critical to comprehend the determinants of accessibility, encompassing the relevance of sociodemographic characteristics. Although several urban areas worldwide may meet the broad interpretation of the 15-minute city concept, our research reveals significant disparities among population segments regarding access to urban services and their prioritization. Our case study found that grocery stores and healthcare facilities hold paramount importance across all population segments. Furthermore, wealthy segments exhibit a heightened preference for retail shops and commercial services. In contrast, the low-income population has a considerably greater preference for healthcare facilities. This study aims to cast light upon structural disparities inherent in urban areas, thereby unveiling inequalities in the 15-minute city concept's capacity to diagnose and mitigate urban inequalities. The promotion of a more all-encompassing and inclusive measurement approach is posited as a contribution to the advancement of our comprehension and the effective implementation of the 15-minute city concept across heterogeneous urban landscapes.},

During the current pandemic, this has coincided with a drive to highlight the importance of merging more activities in the neighbourhood to improve urban vitality and reduce daily commuting. In addition, increasing digitalization and knowledge-intensive activities have transformed the nature of work itself, thus affecting the choice of the workplace with new working spaces ({NWS}) emerging for collaborative and flexible work environments. Therefore, within this context, this study discusses recent chrono-urbanism approaches applied to urban planning and the role of {NWS}. The phenomenon is empirically examined in Oslo and Lisbon through a qualitative analysis of planning documents and a spatial analysis. The results show that most {NWS} are fairly accessible by public transport to users in both cities; although the {NWS} neighbourhoods in Lisbon have a greater diversity of functions compared to Oslo. However, in both cities, the distribution of {NWS} is non-uniform. This may limit residents’ choice to live and work (outside home) in the same neighbourhood.

This paper explores the “15-min city” concept as a structural and functional element for redesigning contemporary cities. Methodologically, a study of three case cities that have adopted this new model of city vision, is carried out. The analysis focus on understanding how the idea of 15-min cities fits the legacies of different cities as described by traditional planning principles in the context of three evaluation pillars: inclusion, safety and health. The paper argues that the 15-min city approach is not a radical new idea since it utilizes long established planning principles. Nevertheless, it uses these principles to achieve the bottom-up promotion of wellbeing while it proposes an alternative way to think about optimal resource allocation in a citywide scale. Hence, application of 15-min city implies a shift in the emphasis of planning from the accessibility of neighborhood to urban functions to the proximity of urban functions within neighborhoods, along with large systemic changes in resource allocation patterns and governance schemes citywide.},

The rhythms of traffic generated by different land uses differ, reflecting differences in human activity patterns. Thus, an understanding of daily ridership and mobility patterns requires an understanding of the relationship between daily ridership patterns and characteristics of stations and their direct environment. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated this relationship. This study aims to propose a framework of identifying urban mobility patterns and urban dynamics from a spatiotemporal perspective and pointing out the linkages between mobility and land cover/land use ({LCLU}). Relying on 1 month’s transactions data from the {AFC} system of Nanjing metro, the 110 metro stations are classified into 7 clusters named as employment-oriented stations, residential-oriented stations, spatial mismatched stations, etc., each characterized by a distinct ridership pattern (combining boarding and alighting). A comparison of the peak hourly ridership of the seven clusters is conducted to verify whether the clustering results are reasonable or not. Finally, a multinomial logit model is used to estimate the relationship between characteristics of the local environment and cluster membership. Results show that the classification based on ridership patterns leads to meaningful interpretable clusters and that significant associations exist between local {LCLU} characteristics, distance to the city center and cluster membership. The analytical framework and findings may be beneficial for improving service efficiency of public transportation and urban planning.},

	abstract = {Today, the majority of the world’s population lives in cities and it is expected that urban population will continue to grow in the coming decades. The increase in urban population will negatively impact urban performance, measured by equal access to amenities, knowledge creation and economic growth, if cities cannot respond to pressures that arise from increased migration. While urban design principles can help solve these problems, many core concepts of city form are often too abstract to allow for quantification of critical key indicators, comparative benchmarking for best practices and rigorous implementation strategies to ensure success. Given the complexity of how people interact with a city, the critical question arises: How does a city’s shape influence its urban performance? In this paper, we intend to address this fundamental question. First, we propose a framework to create a series of urban form typologies, which describe generally, a city’s shape and size, as a unifying concept to describe a city's design underlying pattern. Second, we propose that the urban form typologies can be quantified through the framework, to establish a disciplined methodology to compare the shape and scale of one city to another. The methodology combines topological (street network) and morphological (building form) features of urban form as well as other metrics related to geographic scale, entropy and density. Third, we provide a unified method to evaluate urban performance in terms of urbanization efficiency, innovation metrics and distribution of amenities. Fourth, we apply this framework to study the relationship between city typology and urban performance in order to determine which city designs are best suited to meet the demands of population growth, resource management, and energy usage. We apply this methodology to data gathered on 24 cities worldwide and their internal 8,228 subdivisions. By grouping the subdivisions into 208 agglomerations based on common urban form features, it is possible to identify and characterize their internal tapestry of city form typologies and evaluate their respective urban performance {KPIs}. We show that city typologies have a distinct effect on urban performance, quantify this impact and provide comparisons between the different typologies. Finally, we apply this methodology to evaluate the ability for each city typology to achieve the standards set forth by the 15-minute city, a sustainable development proposition of a decentralized city composed of walkable neighborhoods that provide equal access to housing, education and amenities.},

This paper presents an efficient method for regionalization. The first step creates a connectivity graph that captures the neighbourhood relationship between the spatial objects. The cost of each edge in the graph is inversely proportional to the similarity between the regions it joins. We summarize the neighbourhood structure by a minimum spanning tree ({MST}), which is a connected tree with no circuits. We partition the {MST} by successive removal of edges that link dissimilar regions. The result is the division of the spatial objects into connected regions that have maximum internal homogeneity. Since the {MST} partitioning problem is {NP}‐hard, we propose a heuristic to speed up the tree partitioning significantly. Our results show that our proposed method combines performance and quality, and it is a good alternative to other regionalization methods found in the literature.},

It identifies the predominant pathways in which neighborhoods have changed according to their racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and housing characteristics in the largest {US} metropolitan statistical areas from 1980 to 2010. The distribution of these pathways is subsequently examined between metropolitan statistical areas and the spatial clustering of these trajectories within cities is analyzed. Results reveal a white-flight type process, the establishment of a multiethnic neighborhood, densification of single-family neighborhoods, gentrification in relatively diverse neighborhoods, upgrading of white single family neighborhoods, and the most frequent pathway of all: no change. High-poverty minority and wealthy white neighborhoods are most spatially compact and expanding in a contiguous manner, while multiethnic neighborhoods are relatively dispersed. Six groups of metropolitan statistical areas are identified based upon the similarity of their neighborhood composition. Parallels are drawn between the formation of enduring high-poverty black neighborhoods in Northern and Midwestern cities and the emergence of clusters high-poverty Hispanic neighborhoods in Hispanic destination cities.},

	abstract = {This text attempts to examine the structuring of the urban environment, taking into account the geographically traditional spatial aspects of various phenomena as well as their temporal characteristics. Places are anchored in time and time in turn may be said to unfold in space. It is thus impossible to achieve an understanding of space without the necessary temporal dimension; indeed, the debate over the conceptualization of timespace has gained considerable currency in the social sciences. This text forms a response to this point of interest, providing a discussion of the chronotopic approach. The first part examines the concept of time and timespace, respectively, in the social sciences; particular attention is paid to the non-trivial aspects of the relationship between time and space. The abovementioned chronotope analytical and interpretive model is utilized throughout. For the purposes of this article, the model is defined as a specific part of the urban space defined by a unique temporality, i.e. based on a specific combination of overlapping rhythms. Such an approach opens up the possibility of regionalization on the basis of a specific temporality on different spatial scales. The empirical part of the text attempts to characterize the differentiation of urban space in Brno on the basis of a spectral analysis of three selected rhythms – the work cycle of a given locale, average duration of shopping session and public transport frequency. Model cases of selected urban chronotopes are subsequently developed on the basis of the rhythmicity of these activities.},

The concept, offering a novel perspective of “chrono-urbanism”, adds to existing thematic of Smart Cities and the rhetoric of building more humane urban fabrics, outlined by Christopher Alexander, and that of building safer, more resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities, as depicted in the Sustainable Development Goal 11 of the United Nations.

	abstract = {The European feminist planning community (including the authors) has been addressing the challenge of a gender-just transition to climate neutral cities offering high quality living conditions for all users for decades. The planning model of a “City of proximity” – originally postulated by feminist planners– has recently evolved to the model of the “15 Minute-City”. It is time to revisit 50 years of European urban time policies underlying this planning model and the theoretical ground for a temporal just city (“zeitgerechte Stadt”). The research project “DraussenDaheim” (=At Home Outside) puts this into practice.The project aims to develop a methodology and toolbox which not only serves the participatory assessment of urban public spaces and their complex spatio-temporal use patterns, but also the co-creative simulation-based design of different planning scenarios. Taking into account a gender- and group-specific perspective,  the focus is particularly on the development of less “gender-blind” participation tools that serve the analysis, assessment and co-planning of public open spaces. The target group-specific application of a digitally supported tool mix is described on the basis of two use cases and its added value for the key elements of a  temporal just city, procedural and distributional justice, is shown. By making public spaces and vulnerable user groups a focus for the participatory implementation of temporally and spatially just urban transition, this will help to ensure that the transformation is inclusive, responsive to community needs, environmentally sustainable and socially just. As the core of this paper, examples from European city-regions on time-planning practices as well as from the use cases of the DraussenDaheim project are presented with the purpose of informing gender-responsive participation and planning tools. The conclusions highlight both the potentials and pitfalls of time-planning approaches in collaboratively assessing urban public spaces. Moreover, they anticipate a crucial endeavor: enhancing the adaptability and usability of these spaces for care-givers and care dependents. This task is a crucial step towards a more inclusive and gender just urban transformation.},

Through a sustainability, equity, and livability lens, this paper examines pitfalls of the 15-minute city from a theoretical and spatial analysis perspective and proposes alternative theoretical and methodological directions. The seven pitfalls of the 15-min­ ute city in current literature are summarized as: (1) overstatement of the 15-minute city’s originality, (2) strong decentralization proposed by the 15-minute city theory is unrealistic and unsustainable, (3) focusing on quantity of destinations instead of sufficiency, (4) improperly aggregating facilities, (5) neglecting diverse forms of nature and their characteristics, (6) disregarding public transport in 15-minute city theory or spatial analysis, and (7) ignoring interpersonal differences in walking and cycling when conducting analyses based on the 15-minute city. A set of strategies is proposed to address these pitfalls and reorient the 15-minute city towards improved environmental and societal outcomes.},

	abstract = {Although proximity by densification is a leading strategy to promote sustainable mobility, knowledge of the gendered and situated use of proximity is scarce. This study explores how women and men use nearby amenities in urban environments varying in amenity concentration. We use survey data from cities in western Sweden to analyse how amenity density, socioeconomic factors, and attitudinal factors affect women's and men's choices of activity location, and to explore the motives underlying these choices. Applying a time-geographic understanding of the role of proximity in everyday life, we consider two activities situated in different time–space contexts: grocery shopping and leisure activities. Results indicate that the roles of gender and density vary. The choice of regular grocery store appears gendered to only a limited extent: women and men choose a regular grocery store within a similar distance from home; distances are affected by similar factors; and actual choice is motivated by similar reasons. Density promotes proximate use among both women and men. High economic status, habitual car use, and being foreign born induce women and men to travel farther. For women, environmental concern is associated with reduced travel distances, while experiencing time pressure in everyday life is associated with greater distances. Distinct gender differences are found in chosen leisure activities: men engage in regular leisure activities farther from home than women do, and women's local choices are affected by amenity density while no such association is found among men. Men more seldom cite time-constraint and mode-access reasons for their choice of leisure activity location. Location choices are generally made primarily with regard to quality of service rather than, for example, the possibility of walking or biking. We conclude that proximity is important for both women and men, but that its role varies with activity and gender, reflecting the dynamic relationship between proximity, inherent qualities of the activity, and individual values and conditions. Swedish women, to a larger degree than men, experience limitations regarding access to the city. Policy and planning to promote proximity should consider the gendered contexts of everyday activities and the heterogeneity among women and men regarding needs and desires for and constraints on local living.},

	abstract = {New urbanism is an urban design movement to create pedestrian-oriented settlements that also advance social equity and mitigate the environmental impacts of development. Proponents of the movement have suggested it offers a model of sustainable development. This paper investigates this claim by discussing the implications of empirical research on new urbanism for the ways in which the movement contributes to sustainability. The paper uses the concepts of environmental and social sustainability to frame the discussion. The paper traces the origin of new urbanism and the evolution of its interest in sustainable development. Review of scholarly research on new urbanism in practice shows the movement supports in limited ways both environmental and social sustainability. Moreover, this research also shows that some forms of new urbanism development unintentionally counteract environmental sustainability goals while other forms fail to achieve social sustainability goals. Citing the diverse ways in which new urbanism is put into practice, the paper concludes by considering how understanding the heterogeneity of new urbanism as it exists in the world will impart greater clarity to further analysis of the ways in which the movement actually contributes to sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Previous activity-based studies have shown that behavioural outcomes are the result of complex and multidimensional processes. In this context, identifying and characterizing discrete mobility proﬁles through the classiﬁcation of people’s behavior is particularly attractive. By facilitating the interpretation of complex, multidimensional processes, such an exercise could help to eﬃciently target transport policy decisions. The purpose of this paper is to identify mobility strategy proﬁles considering four key dimensions: time, space, money, and social interaction. Data from a seven-day activity, travel, expenditure, and social interaction diary applied to a sample of residents from the city of Concepción, Chile, is used. A two-step approach based on machine learning techniques is adopted. First, we use a Self-Organizing Map algorithm to identify seven distinct mobility strategies, each characterized by distinctive behaviors. These proﬁles are identiﬁed through 18 weekday and weekend daily behavior variables measuring the four key dimensions mentioned above, with an explicit focus on transport mode use. In the second step, we use a Decision Tree algorithm to proﬁle the mobility strategies by means of personal and household sociodemographic variables. The results show interesting links among the dimensions of analysis within these proﬁles, such as connections between monetary expenditure on leisure and daily social interaction, and that proﬁles with higher private vehicle modal split tend to present higher levels of social interaction with people in their social network than public transit users.},
